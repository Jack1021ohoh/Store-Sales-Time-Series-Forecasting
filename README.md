# Store-Sales-Time-Series-Forecasting

---
### Description
This is a time series forecasting exercise using store sales data. I used machine learning models, such as ARIMA, Exponential smoothing, and deep learning models, such as LSTM, Neural Hierarchical Interpolation for Time Series (NHITS), Temporal Fusion Transformer(TFT), to predict future store sales. Moreover, I used Optuna to search for the best hyperparameters.
