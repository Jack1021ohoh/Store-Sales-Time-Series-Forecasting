# Store-Sales-Time-Series-Forecasting

---
### Description
This project focuses on time series forecasting using store sales data. I employed a range of machine learning and deep learning models to predict future sales, including ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, LSTM, Neural Hierarchical Interpolation for Time Series (NHITS), and Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). To enhance model performance, I utilized Optuna for hyperparameter optimization.
